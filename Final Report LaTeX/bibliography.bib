               care. Transcriptomic data, along with patient characteristics

               pathogenesis. Mechanisms of T2 development, cellular sources of

               pathways concurrently activated may distinguish several

  abstract = "Asthma is the most common inflammatory disease of the lungs. The
              prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world
              that have adopted aspects of the Western lifestyle, and the
              disease poses a substantial global health and economic burden.
              Asthma involves both the large-conducting and the
              small-conducting airways, and is characterized by a combination
              of inflammation and structural remodelling that might begin in
              utero. Disease progression occurs in the context of a
              developmental background in which the postnatal acquisition of
              asthma is strongly linked with allergic sensitization. Most
              asthma cases follow a variable course, involving viral-induced
              wheezing and allergen sensitization, that is associated with
              various underlying mechanisms (or endotypes) that can differ
              between individuals. Each set of endotypes, in turn, produces
              specific asthma characteristics that evolve across the lifecourse
              of the patient. Strong genetic and environmental drivers of
              asthma interconnect through novel epigenetic mechanisms that
              operate prenatally and throughout childhood. Asthma can
              spontaneously remit or begin de novo in adulthood, and the
              factors that lead to the emergence and regression of asthma,
              irrespective of age, are poorly understood. Nonetheless, there is
              mounting evidence that supports a primary role for structural
              changes in the airways with asthma acquisition, on which altered
              innate immune mechanisms and microbiota interactions are
              superimposed. On the basis of the identification of new causative
              pathways, the subphenotyping of asthma across the lifecourse of
              patients is paving the way for more-personalized and precise
              pathway-specific approaches for the prevention and treatment of
              asthma, creating the real possibility of total prevention and
              cure for this chronic inflammatory disease.",

               accommodate demographic information. We analyzed RNA-seq gene
               expression data from 441 asthmatic and 254 non-asthmatic
               samples. Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection
               operator (Lasso) regression analysis in the training set
               identified 73 differentially expressed genes (DEG) to form a
               weighted RSRS that discriminated asthmatics from healthy
               subjects with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the testing
               set after adjustment for age and gender. The 73-gene RSRS was
               validated in three independent RNA-seq datasets and achieved
               AUCs of 0.70, 0.77 and 0.60, respectively. To explore their
               biological and molecular functions in asthma phenotype, we
               examined the 73 genes by enrichment pathway analysis and found
               that these genes were significantly (p < 0.0001) enriched for

  abstract = "There is current evidence to demonstrate a close association
              between fungal sensitisation and asthma severity. Whether such an
              association is causal remains to be confirmed, but this is
              explored by means of a detailed literature review. There is
              evidence from two randomised controlled trials that, in the
              example of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA),
              treatment with systemic antifungal therapy can offer a
              therapeutic benefit to approximately 60\% of patients. ABPA is
              only diagnosed if a combination of clinical and immunological
              criteria is achieved. It is not known whether such cases are a
              discrete clinical entity or part of a spectrum of the pulmonary
              allergic response to fungi or fungal products. This paper
              describes the epidemiological evidence that associates severity
              of asthma with fungi and discusses possible pathogenetic
              mechanisms. Many airborne fungi are involved, including species
              of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium, and
              exposure may be indoors, outdoors or both. The potential for a
              therapeutic role of antifungal agents for patients with severe
              asthma and fungal sensitisation is also explored. Not only are
              many patients with severe asthma desperately disabled by their
              disease, but, in the UK alone, asthma accounts for 1,500 deaths
              per yr. The healthcare costs of these patients are enormous and
              any treatment option merits close scrutiny. Within this report,
              the case for the consideration of a new term related to this
              association is put forward. The current authors propose the term
              ``severe asthma with fungal sensitisation''. However, it is
              recognised that enhanced and precise definition of fungal
              sensitisation will require improvements in diagnostic testing.",

  abstract  = "MOTIVATION: In RNA-seq differential expression analysis,
               investigators aim to detect those genes with changes in
               expression level across conditions, despite technical and
               biological variability in the observations. A common task is to
               accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a
               logarithmic fold change (LFC). RESULTS: When the read counts are
               low or highly variable, the maximum likelihood estimates for the
               LFCs has high variance, leading to large estimates not
               representative of true differences, and poor ranking of genes by
               effect size. One approach is to introduce filtering thresholds
               and pseudocounts to exclude or moderate estimated LFCs.
               Filtering may result in a loss of genes from the analysis with
               true differences in expression, while pseudocounts provide a
               limited solution that must be adapted per dataset. Here, we
               propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for
               effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or
               pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior

  abstract = "AbstractGenome-wide data is used to stratify patients into
              classes for precision medicine using clustering algorithms. A
              common problem in this area is selection of the number of
              clusters (K). The Monti consensus clustering algorithm is a
              widely used method which uses stability selection to estimate K.
              However, the method has bias towards higher values of K and
              yields high numbers of false positives. As a solution, we
              developed Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C),
              which is based on this algorithm. M3C simulates null
              distributions of stability scores for a range of K values thus
              enabling a comparison with real data to remove bias and
              statistically test for the presence of structure. M3C corrects
              the inherent bias of consensus clustering as demonstrated on
              simulated and real expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
              (TCGA). For testing M3C, we developed clusterlab, a new method
              for simulating multivariate Gaussian clusters.",

              graphics are powerful for efficient visualization of patterns and
              relationships among high dimensional genomic data. Here we
              present the ComplexHeatmap package that provides rich
              functionalities for customizing heatmaps, arranging multiple
              parallel heatmaps and including user-defined annotation graphics.
              We demonstrate the power of ComplexHeatmap to easily reveal
              patterns and correlations among multiple sources of information
              with four real-world datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
